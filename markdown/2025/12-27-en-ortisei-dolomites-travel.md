I traveled Italy from Thursday September 25th 2025 to Wednesday October 2nd.
For 7 nights in Italy I went to Rome, Dolomites, Venice, and Florence,
and in this post I will talk about my review on traveling
Seceda, Ortisei and extras around Ortisei Dolomites,
from Friday 26th to Monday 29th.
I enjoyed light walking and trekking from Ortisei to famous sites
using lifts.

# Ortisei Town
![ortisei](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/ortisei-0.webp)

Ortisei is a small town located in the west of Dolomites and
you can go to famous landmarks such as Seceda and Alpe Di Siusi directly using lifts.

Located at a valley among high Dolomites mountains this town sits at quite high altitude of 1,236m.
So you may encounter a little cold weather of 10° Celsius in 4 p.m. late September.
Since places higher than Ortisei like Seceda has lower temperature and strong winds,
you need to be in warm clothes.
![ortisei-temperature](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/ortisei-temperature.webp)

It's not a big town but not that small town.
There are several marts like Despar and Conad City.
It is a good size for traveling.
There is a [tourist information center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c7npMb8bxey4SFaB9),
and that is the center of Ortisei. It's right at the center in the map,
a shopping street is right next to it, and it is near other facilities,
so it can be considered as the center.
![ortisei-info-center](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/ortisei-info-center.webp)

There is another reason why this is the center; there is a toilet on the lower ground floor
in the information center building and gratefully you can use it for free.

Also right beside the lower ground floor entrance there is an Italian post office and a *POSTAMAT* ATM.
They say *POSTAMAT* ATM does not charge withdraw fee with Toss or Travlog cards,
so you may want to withdraw cash here if you need some.\

There are trash cans across Ortisei like the image below and it is very convenient.
They even provide pet waste bags.
I saw how much Ortisei care their tourists.

# Ortisei Lifts
There are as many lifts as attractions in Ortisei.
The lifts are not of the same types; a mix of gondolas, Funicular so you will not be bored riding them.

When I was traveling I could see lift platforms, but not the routes on Google Map
so I could not easily find the answer to 'Where does this lift go?'
but now I see the routes with red dotted lines!
Google Map will help you plan your itinerary.
![ortisei-google-map](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/ortisei-google-map.webp)

But the lift fees are quite expensive.
As of now it costs 59 euros, 97,232 won in 1,648 won/euro rate to book round trip to Seceda online...
Buying tickets every time you board is also cumbersome.

That's why I bought a *Dolomiti Supersummer* card for that.
Dolomiti Supersummer card lets you use lifts in Dolomites during summer
and in 2025, it was from May 23th to November 9th.

I am not sure if it actually includes all the lifts.
But I guess it includes most of them not just in Ortisei but Dolomites since it has Dolomites in its name.
In the link you can check the list of available lifts.\
<https://www.dolomitisuperski.com/en/live-info/lifts>\
At least I could use Dolomites Supersummer card for every lift I used without paying extra fees.

If you booked online it seems you can get a card by scanning a QR code with a machine
called TICKET BOX near the attractions like the picture below. The picture shows a TICKET BOX
next to Seceda lift platform.
![supersummer-card-ticket-box](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/supersummer-card-ticket-box.webp)

I bought it at the day, at a manned ticket counter next to Seceda cable car platform without online
reservation, and a one day adult card costed 65 euros.
Funny thing is they asked me the gender and the card has the gender on it.
They say you cannot give away Supersummer cards to other people,
so I guess it is to stop ticket transfers.\
you can board lifts by tagging your Supersummer card at the marked area in the picture below.

# Seceda
![seceda](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-1.webp)

<br>

You can go to Seceda by a cable car at a uphill northeast from the center of the town.
I guess this is the most famous landmark in Ortisei,
so they had the biggest cable car platform. there is a toilet but not free which was 1.5 euro from my memory.
There was a free toilet at the other platform up there in Seceda so you can use it instead.

To go to Seceda from Ortisei you ride the first lift for 12 minutes and get off to ride the second lift.
![seceda-lift](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-lift.webp)

There are vending machines at the upper Seceda lift platform. I'd like to see vending machines in attractions.
A cola can costs you 3.9 euros and a chocolate bar 2.9 euros.
![seceda-vending-machine](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-vending-machine.webp)

Seceda from the platform is beautiful but I suggest you go near it as the road is not that steep.
As you get closer you start to see vivid textures and this is really beautiful.
![seceda](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-2.webp)

To go right near Seceda you go to *Photo Point* and pay 5 euros.
You can decide on your own flexibly. I took a different slanted path;
it was just not right before Seceda but I was able to get quite close to it.
You follow the path for more and in the middle the Photo Point path and the other path eventually meet.
![seceda-photo-point](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-photo-point.webp)

![seceda-photo-point-meet](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-photo-point-meet.webp)

I took many pictures, rested and walked for 2 hours
I arrived at a restaurant [Malga Pieralongia Alm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q48h5VXsYaaSRAiv8).
There is a toilet but you need to pay 1 euro for toilet only.
I did not feel like eating at the moment so I paid 1 euro to a money box inside the toilet.
![seceda-toilet](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/seceda-toilet.webp)

Seceda's sharp summit is pretty but the view looking down from 2,240m altitude is also a masterpiece.
From Seceda you can observe the scenic views of rolling mountains and the high grounds stretching to the far end.
If you go up to Seceda be sure to look around 360°, not just Seceda itself!

# Alpe Di Siusi
![alpe-di-siusi](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-di-siusi-0.webp)

<br>

Alpe Di Siusi lift platform sits to the south of the center of Ortisei
and you can walk there by a bridge [Ponte Pedonale Ortisei BZ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cuAq5Dbt5G3oqncc7).
![bridge-to-alpe-di-siusi](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/bridge-to-alpe-di-siusi.webp)

You can reach Alpe Di Siusi by the lift for 11 minutes.
There is also a toilet up there at the platform. I don't know if it is free of charge; haven't used it.

The views of Alpe Di Siusi from the lift platform to the far south is great,
but walking around there... I am not sure about that. It really doesn't make sense,
but I felt they are all the same.
![alpe-di-siusi](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-di-siusi-1.webp)

The answer is, then why not go down to south?\
You walk a little to the west and you meet a chair lift named *Panorama*. You can get down by the lift.
![alpe-di-siusi-chairlift](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-di-siusi-chairlift.webp)

Down there, there are some hotels standing along the road and go a bit more to the south
and it is a completely different world.
Mountains such as *Sassolungo* stretching far away and the place where I walk is a high ground
with gentle slopes and this feels really mysterious.
This place is really great but with almost no people.
If I say Seceda is like walking a beautiful place on the Earth then I will say
Alpe Di Siusi is walking a different planet by myself.

![alpe-di-siusi](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-di-siusi-2.webp)

![alpe-di-siusi](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-di-siusi-3.webp)

![alpe-di-siusi](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-di-siusi-4.webp)

I returned around [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WN7frAiRSTxqCYxA8) on Google Map,
and it took about 27 minutes to get from the chair lift to the return point.
There were no building with toilets at a glance as I went deeper so be careful with your jouney.

# Alpe Resciesa
![alpe-resciesa](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-0.webp)

There were a little time left so I tried the lift to Alpe Resciesa.
Unlike usual lifts this train goes and up down the slope, and they call them Funicular.
It takes 9 minutes to go up there.
![alpe-resciesa-funicular](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-funicular.webp)

Near the upper lift platform there is a restaurant, and if you go down around the outside the restaurant
there is a free toilet.
It even provides **liquid soap** and as of my memory this was the best toilets out of lift platform toilets.
![alpe-resciesa-restaurant](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-restaurant.webp)

![alpe-resciesa-toilet](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-toilet.webp)

<br>

Alpe Resciesa is a forest trail with exposed roots, low-height bushes and pine trees; it felt like Jeju island.
Sorry for Alpe Resciesa but I could not go that far as I was tired after the two attractions on the day.
It was also almost the sunset.
![alpe-resciesa-path](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-path.webp)

Nontheless up in the mountain of the north to Ortisei this place is good to observe the south.
![alpe-resciesa-south](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-south.webp)

![alpe-resciesa](/img/2025-12-27-ortisei-dolomites-travel/alpe-resciesa-1.webp)

I did not study enough about Alpe Resciesa and wondered around aimlessly,
but if I have chance to go there again then I would probably go for
[Ausserraschötzer Kreuz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DLa2ecqwiVU75oqVA),
with wide sloped plateau with pretty scenery.
