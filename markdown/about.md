Hi, my name is Lee Hyeonjae, a lifelong student majoring in software, in South Korea.<br>

I am interested in almost every part of computer science,
but if I need to pick what is my favorite, I would pick Web Frontend.
I think cloud service in an extended definition is one of the most popular computing services,
and providing users UI and UX in a uniform way no matter what client devices are is important.
The most common way to do that is through Web,
and Web Frontend is at the front.
