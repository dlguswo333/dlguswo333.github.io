Hi, my name is Lee Hyeonjae, a lifelong student majoring in software, in South Korea.

I am interested in almost every part of computer science,
but if I need to pick what is my favorite, I would pick Web Frontend.
I think cloud service in an extended definition is one of the most popular computing services,
and providing users UI and UX in a uniform way no matter what client devices are is important.
The most common way to do that is through Web,
and Web Frontend is at the front.

My skills are mostly based on Web Frontend. I do Javascript and love Typescript.
With the languages I also do things in Node.JS other than Web Frontend.
But I also like to learn other things that intrigues me.

Visit my [github.io page](https://dlguswo333.github.io) if you want to know more about what I have done, and who I am.\
Software is fun, I also would like to talk about other interesting things.
